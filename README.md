# NMOpt

**BFGS** is an simple implementation of the Newton' methods in Julia.
The main objectives of those methods is to solve convex optimization
problem, possibly with constraints and/or limited memory.

The documentation will come at some point:

* [Algorithm](src/README.md) describes the algorithm implemented in the module;

* [Use](test/README.md) describes how to use the module and explains what should 
be implemented for a specific problem;
