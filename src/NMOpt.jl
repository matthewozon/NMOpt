module NMOpt # Newton based optimization Method 

using LinearAlgebra # norm is in there

export trial_alpha, interval_update, belong_to, line_search # those functions are not mean to be used by the end user and shouldn't be exported, but they are for the time being

# probably not the best names
export BFGS, BFGSB, LBFGS, LBFGSB # BFGS, constrained BFGS, limited memory BFGS and bounded limited memory BFGS
